# 🌱 Seetropy: A Secure and Customizable Mnemonic Phrase Generator

Seetropy is an open-source application designed to elevate the security and customization of mnemonic phrase generation. By leveraging unique images captured through your camera as a source of entropy, Seetropy enables the creation of truly one-of-a-kind mnemonic phrases. Additionally, with the optional Entropy Boost feature, you can add an extra layer of security that makes it extremely costly and difficult for anyone to reproduce your mnemonic phrase—even if they have access to your original image.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **📷 Image-Based Entropy:** Capture a unique image using your camera to generate a secure mnemonic phrase. The image acts as a personal and non-replicable source of entropy, making your mnemonic phrase truly unique.
- **🔐 Entropy Boost:** Add an extra layer of security with a custom phrase or word. This optional feature protects against the risk of unauthorized access, even if someone obtains the original image.
- **🖥️ User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity and security in mind, Seetropy offers an intuitive UI that guides you through the process of generating and securing your mnemonic phrase.
- **💾 Comprehensive Backup:** Clear instructions and warnings ensure that users understand the importance of securely storing their entropy sources and Entropy Boost to maintain access to their mnemonic phrase.

## 🚀 Get Started

Seetropy is ideal for anyone looking to take control of their digital security by generating custom, non-predictable mnemonic phrases.

## 🚧 Project in Progress

Seetropy is currently under active development as I work to bring the next level of security and customization to mnemonic phrase generation. Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to contribute code, suggest new features, or provide feedback, your input will help shape the future of Seetropy.
